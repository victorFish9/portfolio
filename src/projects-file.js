        description: "I developed a responsive website to provide essential information for exchange students in Finland. The website is accessible on smartphones and is designed for easy updates by users with no coding experience. Leveraging GitHub workflows, I implemented a system that automatically deploys the site after each commit, simplifying future updates by board members. The site features dynamic information pages and event cards, reducing the need for hardcoding and ensuring that all content is easily updatable. This project was built using the React library.",

        description: "I developed a full-stack e-commerce website for a dog store as part of a university team project, creating a back-end API to manage products, users, customers, and manufacturers. The Main API serves as a central hub, linking to resources like products, manufacturers, types, customers, and users. The User Management API handles user registration, authentication, and roles, including creating, updating, and deleting profiles. The Manufacturer API manages manufacturer details and associated products. The Product Type API categorizes products for easy filtering. The Customer API manages customer profiles and supports searching. This project built a comprehensive API for efficient management of the storeâ€™s key business data.",
